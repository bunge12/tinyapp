# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). **BEWARE**: This app was published for learning purposes and it is not intended for use in production-grade software.

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.

## Final Product

- Shortens URLs to a 6-character link
- RESTful
- Tracks total and unique hits (analytics available only to link creator)
- Easy-to-use and intuitive interface
